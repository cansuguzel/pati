# pati_kampus_demo

A new Flutter project.
I worked as a Flutter developer in an IoT-based pet feeder social responsibility project using a Firebase database. As part of the project, I designed the user interface for the mobile application, enabling remote control and data tracking.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
